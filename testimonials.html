        <h2>An interview with Amos, Delivery Driver and ADGWU member</h2>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h3>What do you do?</h3>
            <p>
                I’ve been a delivery driver for about 10 years, working on Deliveroo and other apps.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h3>How did you get into delivery?</h3>
            <p>
                The whole thing started when I was looking for part-time work while studying, during the middle of the
                pandemic. Victoria faced one of the strictest quarantines imaginable, and since everyone had to stay
                inside, the demand for food delivery was high
                (<a href="https://mattersmagazine.com.au/articles/the-explosive-rise-of-food-delivery-services"
                    target="_blank">Matters Magazine</a>).
                The flexibility
                (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1440783319894060" target="_blank">Campbell et al. 2020</a>)
                drew me in, since I could fit it around my study schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduating, I struggled to break into the job market, with many entry-level positions replaced by
                AI (<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/06/05/ai-replacing-tech-jobs/84016842007/"
                    target="_blank">USA Today, 2025</a>).
                Since I was already delivering, I kept doing it while job-hunting. Even after securing a job, I
                continued delivery to supplement my income.

            <h3>What challenges did you face as a delivery gig worker?</h3>
            <p>
                Flexibility is a double-edged sword. You can choose your hours, but work isn’t guaranteed, and you might
                spend hours logged in with no jobs. At first, I got high-paying jobs, but they dwindled
                (<a href="https://prospect.org/labor/like-uber-but-for-gig-worker-organizing/" target="_blank">Prospect,
                    2018</a>),
                forcing me to take long trips under minimum wage. The system relies heavily on tips
                (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/doordash-new-york-tips-delivery-workers"
                    target="_blank">Guardian, 2025</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                If something goes wrong, drivers pay the cost. Repairs and fuel are on us. Disputes usually favour
                customers (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ilr.12376"
                    target="_blank">International Labour Review</a>).
                And accidents? Too many horror stories — mates covering medical bills themselves
                (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/09/australian-food-delivery-workers-had-pay-cut-amid-increased-pandemic-demand"
                    target="_blank">Guardian, 2020</a>).

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h3>How did you find the ADGWU?</h3>
            <p>
                One of their members approached me while I was waiting for a job. I was surprised such an organisation
                existed, since drivers are scattered
                (<a href="https://uniontrack.com/blog/unionizing-the-gig-economy" target="_blank">UnionTrack</a>).
                At the time, drivers were contractors
                (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1035304617722461#bibr45-1035304617722461"
                    target="_blank">Rawling &amp; Howe 2017</a>),
                which made unionising harder. But they told me about a protest outside Parliament, gave me the link, and
                walked off. That got me involved.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h3>How has your work changed after joining ADGWU?</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Digital Workers Rights Act</strong> was the big change. Platforms had to acknowledge their
                algorithmic control over jobs. Now, all deliveries must be offered for $25 or more, plus compensation
                for
                operational costs
                (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1024258917701381" target="_blank">Todolí-Signes
                    2021</a>).
                I can usually make around $300 a day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Benefits once off-limits — super, insurance, safety protections, guaranteed pay — are now included,
                making delivery sustainable as my primary income.
