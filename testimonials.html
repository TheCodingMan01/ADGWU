        <h1>Testimonials</h1>
        <h2>An interview with Amos, Delivery Driver and ADGWU member</h2>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h3>What do you do?</h3>
            <p>
                Well I’ve been a delivery driver for about 10 years, working on Deliveroo, alongside a couple other
                apps.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h3>How did you get into delivery?</h3>
            <p>
                The whole thing started when I was looking for part-time work while studying, which was during the
                middle of the pandemic.
                Victoria faced one of the worst quarantine’s imaginable, and since everyone had to stay inside and
                couldn’t go out to eat,
                the <a href="https://mattersmagazine.com.au/articles/the-explosive-rise-of-food-delivery-services"
                    target="_blank">demand for food delivery was high</a>.
                The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1440783319894060" target="_blank">flexibility</a> drew me in, as it
                meant I could fit it around my study schedule and do it any time.
            </p>
            <p>
                After I graduated, I struggled getting into the job market, since a lot of previously entry-level
                positions were being
                <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/06/05/ai-replacing-tech-jobs/84016842007/"
                    target="_blank">replaced by AI</a>.
                Since I was already doing delivery, I figured I could just keep doing that while job-hunting. Even after
                I managed to secure a job,
                I was still doing delivery work on the side to supplement my income.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h3>What challenges did you face as a delivery gig worker?</h3>
            <p>
                Flexibility is a double-edged sword. While you can decide your hours, work isn’t guaranteed, and you
                might spend hours just browsing the app,
                and not getting any jobs, which is demoralising.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I initially signed up to Deliveroo, I got a lot of high-paying jobs at first, before they
                <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/like-uber-but-for-gig-worker-organizing/" target="_blank">slowly
                    started to dwindle</a>
                and I ended up having to accept many far away jobs that went for under minimum wage.
                The system relies on <a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/doordash-new-york-tips-delivery-workers"
                    target="_blank">supplementing costs through tips</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You quickly learn that if something goes wrong, you pay the price. It’s expected that repair costs and
                fuel are covered by the driver.
                In the case of customer disputes, their systems will <a
                    href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ilr.12376?saml_referrer"
                    target="_blank">favour the customer</a>.
                And if you get into an accident, oh boy. I’ve heard so many horror stories of my mates who get into
                accidents and have to shoulder the
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/09/australian-food-delivery-workers-had-pay-cut-amid-increased-pandemic-demand"
                    target="_blank">medical bills out of pocket</a>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h3>How did you find the ADGWU?</h3>
            <p>
                One of their members approached me while I was waiting on my next delivery.
                I was surprised such an organization existed, since drivers like me are
                <a href="https://uniontrack.com/blog/unionizing-the-gig-economy" target="_blank">usually scattered
                    around</a>,
                and it would be hard to get us all in one place. At the time, drivers were classified as
                <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1035304617722461#bibr45-1035304617722461"
                    target="_blank">independent contractors</a>,
                which added less legitimacy to the idea of unionizing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways, the bloke talked to me about an upcoming protest they were organizing around the Parliament
                house for this legislation they were trying to pass,
                gave me the event link and then walked off.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h3>How has your working experience changed after joining the ADGWU?</h3>
            <p>
                The major improvement was the <strong>Digital Workers Rights Act</strong>. After that passed, a lot of
                things changed for the better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Platforms have acknowledged the amount of algorithmic control they have over what jobs get shown to who,
                and have made efforts to gear their platforms towards benefiting their workers.
                They’ve made it mandatory that all deliveries must be offered for $25 or more, along with a separate
                compensation for
                <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1024258917701381" target="_blank">operational
                    costs</a> such as fuel.
                So I’m able to make around $300 a day most days.
            </p>
            <p>
                They also introduced benefits and services that used to be off-limits for workers, such as super,
                insurance, safety protections, and hourly guaranteed pay,
                all of which have made it sustainable for me to become my primary source of income.
            </p>
