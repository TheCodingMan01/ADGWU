            <h1>About ADGWU</h1>
            <p>
                The Australian Digital Gig Workers Union (ADGWU) was founded in response to the growing
                need for fair representation in an increasingly platform-driven economy. As work became
                more digital and decentralised in the 2020s, gig workers across Australia faced rising precarity,
                low wages, algorithmic control, and limited access to basic protections.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2021, the federal government released the
                <a href="https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22committees%2Freportsen%2F024635%2F0000%22"
                    target="_blank">
                    First Interim Report: On-Demand Platform Work in Australia</a>. The report urged expanded
                data collection by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Safe Work Australia, recommended
                that the <em>Fair Work Act 2009</em> be extended to gig workers, and called for the introduction
                of workers’ compensation schemes funded by platform companies. These early findings set the
                stage for a decade of advocacy and reform.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2033, the passage of the <strong>Digital Workers Rights Act</strong> marked a turning point,
                with ADGWU playing a leading role in securing collective bargaining rights, minimum pay guarantees,
                superannuation, and transparency for all platform-based workers. Our work builds on years of
                organising by the Transport Workers Union (TWU), the Australian Unemployed Workers’ Union (AUWU),
                and digital rights researchers who exposed the costs of algorithmic management. International
                solidarity also inspired ADGWU, including examples like <a

            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p><em>Empowering the Future of Work</em></p>
            <p>
                At ADGWU, our mission is to champion the rights, dignity, and prosperity of gig workers
                across Australia in an increasingly digital and decentralised economy. As the nature of work evolves,
                we stand united to ensure fair pay, secure working conditions, and equitable access to benefits for all
                independent contractors, freelancers, and platform-based workers.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fair Representation:</strong> Giving gig workers a collective voice in policy-making,
                    platform governance, and workplace standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Security:</strong> Pushing for universal access to healthcare, superannuation, paid
                    leave, and income protection regardless of employment classification.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Justice:</strong> Ensuring transparency and accountability in algorithmic
                    management, data usage, and platform ratings.</li>
                <li><strong>Community and Solidarity:</strong> Building a strong, inclusive network of support,
                    education, and opportunity for all gig workers, regardless of industry or background.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Together, we are redefining the future of work — where flexibility meets fairness, and independence is
                backed by collective strength.
