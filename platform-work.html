        <h1>About Digital Platform Work</h1>

        <p>
            The Parliament of Australia defines gig work as “A range of terms describe the gig economy:
            on-demand, gig, sharing, collaborative, crowdsourcing, and short-term, project-based and outcome-defined
            independent or ‘freelance’ work”
            (<a href="https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/library/prspub/8885069/upload_binary/8885069.pdf"
                target="_blank">Murphy, 2022</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
            A <a href="https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/publications/working-papers/search/result?paper=3737012"
                target="_blank">2019 survey</a> found that 7.1% of Australians had offered to work on a digital platform
            in the past 12 months, but only 0.2% relied on it full time for income. Thanks to platforms reducing
            transaction costs, expanding access, and increasing trust in payments, the gig economy continues to grow.
            Coupled with economic change, demand for flexible income, and work-life balance, digital platform work has
            expanded rapidly (Murphy, 2022).
        </p>

        <p>
            Distributions of gig work in Australia (as of 2019) included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>18.6% in food delivery</li>
            <li>16.9% in professional services</li>
            <li>11.6% in odd jobs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(Borland et al., 2022)</p>

        <h2>Definitions and Legal Context</h2>
        <p>
            In 2021, the
            <a href="https://engage.vic.gov.au/inquiry-on-demand-workforce" target="_blank">
                First Interim Report: On-Demand Platform Work in Australia</a>
            noted that terms like "gig economy," "on-demand work," and "platform work" are often contested and
            inconsistently applied. While platform work resembles labour hire in some ways, there are key differences:
            labour hire companies employ and pay workers, while gig platforms classify them as contractors, shifting
            risks and costs.
        </p>

        <p>The report clarifies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>On-demand work</strong>: a broad term including labour hire, casual work, fixed-term contracts,
                and contracting; also used specifically within the gig sector.</li>
            <li><strong>Gig work</strong>: a subset of on-demand work.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform work</strong>: on-demand work facilitated by digital platforms or apps.</li>
            <li>Available across multiple sectors with varying models.</li>
            <li>Most platform workers are classified as contractors, not employees, and thus outside the
                <em>Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth)</em>.
            </li>
            <li>Most gig workers lack leave entitlements, minimum pay, or other labour protections.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            As legislation struggles to keep pace, ADGWU continues to advocate for platform workers’ rights to fair pay,
            safe conditions, and protections equal to other Australian workers.
