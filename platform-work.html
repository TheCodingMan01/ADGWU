        <h1>About Digital Platform Work</h1>

        <p>
            The <a
                href="https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_departments/Parliamentary_Library/Research/Briefing_Book/47th_Parliament/GigEconomy"
                target="_blank">Parliament of Australia</a> defines gig work as “A range of terms describe the gig
            economy (p. 7):
            on-demand, gig, sharing (p. 6), collaborative, crowdsourcing, and short-term, project-based and outcome
            defined
            independent or ‘freelance’ work.”
        </p>

        <p>
            A <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/system/files/documents/b148083d79e89d2e287eb9ddd2410f6c/Borland%2C%20Coelli%20-%20The%20Australian%20labour%20market%20and%20the%20digital%20economy.pdf"
                target="_blank">2019 survey</a> found that 7.1 percent of Australia’s population had offered to work on
            a digital
            platform in the past 12 months, but only 0.2 percent were completely reliant on it for income and doing it
            full time.
            Thanks to digital platforms increasing the scope and frequency of transactions, reducing the costs of
            transactions and
            increasing accessibility and trust in regards to payments from businesses, the Australian gig economy is
            expanding.
        </p>

        <p>
            This, coupled with the changing economy causing more workers to seek extra income and workers looking for
            better
            work-life balance or more flexible working arrangements, means that the industry is expanding quickly.
            Distributions of
            gig work in Australia as of 2019 included concentrations of 18.6 percent in food delivery, 16.9 percent in
            professional
            services and 11.6 percent in odd jobs.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2021, the
            <a href="https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22committees%2Freportsen%2F024635%2F0000%22"
                target="_blank">First interim report: on-demand platform work in Australia</a> notes that “The terms
            'gig economy',
            'gig work', 'on-demand work' and 'platform work' are often difficult to define, and their meanings can
            sometimes be
            contested.” It references scholars saying that on-demand work is increasing in Australia while legislation
            isn’t keeping
            up.
        </p>

        <p>
            They then go on to clarify that gig work is “closely associated with online platforms” and that while it can
            resemble
            labour hire, it has distinct differences in how people are employed (labour hire companies employ and pay
            people, gig
            work platforms treat them more like independent contractors) and how reimbursement is then negotiated.
        </p>

        <p><strong>They then define the terms as follows:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>'On-demand work' can be a broad term including labour hire, casual work, fixed-term contracts and
                independent
                contracting; it can also be used as a more specific term within the gig sector.</li>
            <li>'Gig work' can be seen as a subset of on-demand work.</li>
            <li>'Platform work' is on-demand work that is facilitated by web-based platforms or apps.</li>
            <li>Platform work is available across a range of sectors, using different operating models.</li>
            <li>Most gig or platform workers in Australia are classified as 'independent contractors', rather than
                'employees' and
                are not covered by the <em>Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth)</em>.</li>
            <li>Most gig workers do not have leave entitlements, minimum rates of pay, or other protections of labour
                regulation.
            </li>
        </ul>
