            <p class="article-meta">Sydney · <time datetime="2035-05-10">May 10, 2035</time></p>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>Many gig work digital platforms are encompassed in the on-demand sector of the <a
                        href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210422417300114?via%3Dihub#sec0010"
                        target="_blank"><strong>‘Sharing Economy’</strong></a> which allows assets to be rented and
                    shared rather than individually owned. Some have taken the idea to heart, and devised mutual aid
                    initiatives as a way to look out for fellow gig workers.</p>

                <p>Our focus today is the <a href="https://gigworkers.org.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Gig Workers
                            Hub</strong></a> established by Andrew Copolov in the Melbourne CBD, a shelter that provides
                    gig workers food, drinks and access to bathrooms and charging stations. Although the original hub
                    was closed in 2024, it has inspired the opening of similar centers in other major cities across
                    Australia that are affiliated via a digital network.</p>

                <p><strong>Lori Michaels</strong>, the manager of the hub located in the Sydney CBD, tells the story of
                    how she found out about the Gig Workers Hub.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    “I actually discovered them through their website and ended up visiting a couple times. As someone
                    who’s done deliveries to get by in the past, I thought it was a brilliant idea.
                </blockquote>

                <p>When I was there, I noticed the hub was more than just a simple rest spot, but the beginnings of an
                    informal <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3479563" target="_blank"><strong>mutual aid
                            network</strong></a>, back when unions for gig workers were less established. People who
                    came there to get out of the rain would find themselves coming back with friends. It became a place
                    of community and solidarity, where snacks and info were freely shared.</p>

                <p>After it closed, I reached out to Copolov to see if it could be reopened. Over the years, with
                    successful crowdfunding campaigns and additional grants by the city’s councils, we’ve managed to
                    establish hubs in Sydney, Canberra, Gold Coast and Perth. The hub’s services are generously
                    supported by online donations. It seems people really appreciate these places and just want to give
                    back.</p>
