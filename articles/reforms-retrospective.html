            <p class="article-meta">Sydney · <time datetime="2034-01-18">January 18, 2034</time></p>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>As digital workers bask in the glory of the Digital Workers Rights Act, championed by the ADGWU, we
                    take a moment to reflect back on the early stages of gig work, and the trials and tribulations
                    experienced by those pioneering the industry.</p>

                <p>In 2024, the federal government announced long-awaited workplace protections for rideshare, food
                    delivery and truck drivers, including ensuring platforms must
                    <a href="https://ministers.dewr.gov.au/watt/better-workplace-protections-rideshare-food-delivery-and-truck-drivers"
                        target="_blank">follow a fair process</a> when deactivating workers, but in 2030, critics say
                    the reforms hadn’t kept pace with the growing dominance of gig platforms.
                </p>

                <p>These measures followed pressure from organisations like the Transport Workers Union (TWU) and the
                    Australian Unemployed Workers’ Union, who campaigned throughout the 2020s to close legal loopholes
                    that allowed platforms to avoid treating workers as employees.</p>

                <p>Other issues were also prevalent particularly to marginalised workers, for example women working dual
                    roles as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ntwe.12233" target="_blank">platform workers and also
                        caregivers</a>. Platform work was also shown to further reinforce existing inequalities rather
                    than mitigate them, as told in a report by
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0022185618800518" target="_blank">Flanagan</a>. Further to this,
                    platform
                    owners maintained that they were simply
                    intermediaries between the gig workers and the work, and were not responsible for ensuring workers
                    had <a

                        target="_blank">minimum wage or other benefits</a>.
                </p>

                <p>The Fair Work Commission began reviewing applications for ‘employee like’ benefits
                    <a href="https://www.fwc.gov.au/work-conditions/regulated-worker-minimum-standards/regulated-worker-minimum-standards-cases/ms2024-3"
                        target="_blank">submitted by the TWU in 2025</a>, which had responses from internal platform
                    giants such as Uber, Amazon, DoorDash and MenuLog.

                <p>Victoria’s <a href="https://engage.vic.gov.au/inquiry-on-demand-workforce" target="_blank">Inquiry
                        into the On-Demand Workforce (2020)</a> had already recommended enforceable minimum standards
                    and a licensing scheme for platforms. Yet, many of those recommendations remain unfulfilled.</p>

                <p>We are now pleased to announce that ADGWU have successfully passed legislation that provides
                    Australian gig workers with the following benefits previously only experienced by full time and part
                    time staff:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Guaranteed minimum pay</li>
                    <li>Superannuation inclusion</li>
                    <li>Access to dispute resolution</li>
                    <li>Health and safety protections</li>
                    <li>Limits on unpaid waiting time</li>
                </ul>
